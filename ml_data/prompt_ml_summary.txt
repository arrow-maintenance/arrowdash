# Task
- Create a high-level 300 word summary of the Arrow dev mailing list. Do NOT go over this length.
- It should be targeted at developers seeking an overview of Apache Arrow priorities
- Identify overarching project goals and areas needing attention
- Acknowledge single-instance discussions if they appear to indicate project 
priorities or highlight potential challenges. 
- Briefly mention completed releases and votes for context but don't focus on these
- Synthesize information across different threads to identify overarching project goals and areas needing attention. 
- Acknowledge single-instance discussions if they appear to indicate project priorities or 
highlight potential challenges. 

# output style
- Include 3-5 bullet points for each of the topics: "ongoing discussions"", "emerging themes",
"potential roadblocks", and "strategic plans".
- For each bullet point, include titles of any threads for the relevant discussion(s) and one or more links using the format "[Thread](https://lists.apache.org/list?dev@arrow.apache.org:lte=2M:<thread_title>)".  The link text should always just say "Thread". You can include more than one for each topic - as many as necessary. For the thread_title part: first remove any "Re: " prefix from the beginning, then replace spaces with %20, remove colons entirely, remove square brackets entirely, and replace any other special characters with their single URL-encoded equivalent (not double-encoded)
- Don't include links to threads talking about the mailing list summary on the dashboard.
- Include the topics as h2 headings in markdown format, i.e. '# Heading'
- Don't add unnecessary fluff or intros or conclusions, just give me the overview


# example of a good output

Here's a partial example of good output:
'## Ongoing Discussions

*   **Language Implementation Decoupling:**
Splitting language implementations (JS, Swift) into separate repositories remains a central theme. Focus is on independent releases, reduced maintenance burdens, and language-specific adaptation: [Thread 1](https://lists.apache.org/list?dev@arrow.apache.org:lte=2M:Split%20Swift%20to%20separated%20repository) [Thread 2](https://lists.apache.org/list?dev@arrow.apache.org:lte=2M:Other%20%Swift)'
