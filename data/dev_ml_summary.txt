* **New IPC ApplicationData message type:** A proposal to add a new `ApplicationData` or `OpaqueBytes` message type to the IPC format to allow users to embed arbitrary metadata within streams. [Thread](https://lists.apache.org/list?dev@arrow.apache.org:lte=2M:IPC%20MessageType%20-%20OpaqueBytes)

* **Release provenance and security standards:** Significant discussion was triggered by a checksum mismatch on GitHub-hosted archives, leading to new requirements for including SHA256 hashes directly in vote emails.
